  Z-axis state-dependent behavior morph for TLX493D sensor
  
  This behavior switches between different bindings based on the Z-axis
  state (normal/pressed) detected by the TLX493D sensor.
  
  Usage:
    z_axis_morph: z_axis_morph {
        compatible = "zmk,behavior-z-axis-morph";
        bindings = <&mkp MCLK>, <&mkp MCLK &kp LSHIFT>;
    };

compatible: "zmk,behavior-z-axis-morph"

include: one_param.yaml

properties:
  bindings:
    type: phandle-array
    required: true

      Array of exactly 2 behaviors:
      - Index 0: Normal state binding (Z-axis not pressed)
      - Index 1: Pressed state binding (Z-axis pressed)
