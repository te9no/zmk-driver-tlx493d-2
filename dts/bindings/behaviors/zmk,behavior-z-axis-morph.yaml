  Z-axis state dependent behavior morph

  This behavior allows different behavior bindings to be invoked based on
  the Z-axis state of a 3D Hall sensor (e.g., TLX493D).

  - Normal state (Z not pressed): Invokes the first binding
  - Pressed state (Z pressed down): Invokes the second binding

      A list of two behaviors: normal state binding and pressed state binding.
      The first binding is used when Z-axis is in normal state.
      The second binding is used when Z-axis is pressed down.
