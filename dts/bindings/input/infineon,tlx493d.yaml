    required: true
  
  polling-interval-ms:

    description: Polling interval in milliseconds
    
  reset-gpios:
    type: phandle-array
    description: |
      Reset GPIO pin (active low). When specified, the driver will use
      hardware reset for more reliable sensor recovery from ADC hang conditions.
      
  power-gpios:
    type: phandle-array
    description: |
      Power control GPIO pin (active high). When specified, the driver can
      perform complete power cycles for sensor recovery.
      
  addr-pin-high:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Set this property if the ADDR pin is connected to VDD (high).
      If not set, ADDR pin is assumed to be connected to GND (low).
      This affects the I2C address: 0x5E (ADDR=low) or 0x1F (ADDR=high).
